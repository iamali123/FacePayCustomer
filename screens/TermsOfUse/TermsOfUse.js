              The privacy policy is one of the most essential legal requirements
              for websites.
              {"\n"} {"\n"}
              Even if you just have a small business or a blog with no income at
              all, you might be surprised to discover that you still need a
              privacy policy.
              {"\n"} {"\n"}
               Basically, if your website collects personal data,
              you need a privacy policy that informs your users about this
              according to privacy laws in most jurisdictions, including the EU
              and the US.
              {"\n"} {"\n"}
              Almost all modern websites function with the use of
              cookies, so chances are high that your website is collecting
              personal data, for example for statistical, functional or
              marketing purposes. 
              {"\n"} {"\n"}
              In this blogpost, we take a look at what
              constitutes a good privacy policy, how to make a compliant GDPR
              privacy policy and whether using a privacy policy generator is a
              good idea.
              {"\n"} {"\n"}
              Learn what the privacy policy is and how to get one for
              your website below. What is a privacy policy? A privacy policy is
              a document that states what personal data you collect from your
              users, why, and how you keep it private. 
              {"\n"} {"\n"}
              The purpose of the
              privacy policy is to inform your users about how their data is
              being handled. Hence, the privacy policy should be accessible for
              your users and kept in a plain and readable language. 
              {"\n"} {"\n"}
              Most
              countries have privacy laws requiring that websites collecting
              personal data have a proper privacy policy in place. Failure to
              comply can result in heavy fines and even prosecution. Are you
              based in the EU or providing services to EU citizens, you must
              have a GDPR compliant privacy policy on your domain. We will get
              into this in more detail below. What is personal data? Personal
              data is information that can identify an individual, either
              directly or when combined with other data. Names, e-mails,
              addresses, localization, IP-addresses, photos, and account
              information all are directly identifying data. Health information,
              income, religion and cultural profiles and the like is also
              personal data. Furthermore, and crucial in the present context,
              data on user behavior is also personal. Cookies can track and
              register individual users??? browsing activities, like what articles
              they scroll past and which ones they choose to click on.
